Perform zero-shot text classification based on the following idea: for a given prompt 
and completion text pair, what's the probability that the completion comes after the 
prompt? Hence the name:

> **C**ompletion<br>
  **A**fter<br>
  **P**rompt<br>
  **Pr**obability<br>

## Usage

<details>
<summary>Use a model from the OpenAI API</summary>

Specifically, this model must be compatible with the
[/v1/completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility)
endpoint.

Let's classify
[this sentiment example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/classification)
from the OpenAI text completion docs.

```python
from cappr.openai.classify import predict

tweet = 'I loved the new Batman movie!'
prompt = f'Tweet: {tweet}\nSentiment:'

class_names = ('positive', 'neutral', 'negative')
prior       = (   1/8    ,    1/8   ,     3/4   )

preds = predict(prompts=[prompt],
                completions=class_names,
                prior=prior,
                model='text-ada-001')
preds
# ['positive']
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Use a model from the HuggingFace model hub</summary>

Specifically, this model must be able to be loaded using
`transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model)`.

Smaller LMs may not work well. But there will likely be better ones in the hub soon.

```python
from cappr.huggingface.classify import predict

prompt = 'Which planet is closer to the Sun: Mercury or Earth?'

class_names = ('Mercury', 'Earth')
prior = None  # uniform prior

preds = predict(prompts=[prompt],
                completions=class_names,
                prior=prior,
                model='gpt2')
preds
# ['Mercury']
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Run in batches</summary>

Let's use `huggingface` for this example cuz it's free. And let's predict probabilities
instead of the class.

```python
from cappr.huggingface.classify import predict_proba

prompts = [
    'Stephen Curry is a',
    'Martina Navratilova was a',
    "Dexter, from the TV Series Dexter's Laboratory, is a",
    'LeBron James is a',    
]

# each of the prompts could be completed with one of these:
class_names = (
    'basketball player',
    'tennis player',
    'scientist'
)

prior = (
    1/6,  # few
    1/6,  # few
    2/3   # there are more
)

pred_probs = predict_proba(prompts=prompts,
                           completions=class_names,
                           prior=prior,
                           batch_size=32,  # whatever fits on your CPU/GPU
                           model='gpt2')

# pred_probs[i,j] = probability that prompts[i] is classified as class_names[j]
print(pred_probs.round(1))
# [[0.5 0.3 0.2]
#  [0.3 0.6 0.2]
#  [0.1 0.1 0.8]
#  [0.8 0.2 0. ]]

# for each prompt, which completion is most likely?
pred_class_idxs = pred_probs.argmax(axis=1)
print([class_names[pred_class_idx] for pred_class_idx in pred_class_idxs])
# ['basketball player',
#  'tennis player',
#  'scientist',
#  'basketball player']
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Run in batches, where each prompt has a different set of possible completions
</summary>

Again, let's use `huggingface` to predict probabilities. And this time, let's pass in an 
instantiated model and tokenizer instead of its name. That way, the model isn't
re-loaded every time you wanna use it.

```python
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

from cappr import Example
from cappr.huggingface.classify import predict_proba_examples

examples = [
    Example(prompt='Jodie Foster played',
            completions=('Clarice Starling', 'Trinity in The Matrix')),
    Example(prompt='Batman, from Batman: The Animated Series, was played by',
            completions=('Kevin Conroy', 'Pete Holmes', 'Spongebob!'),
            prior=      (     2/3      ,      1/3     ,      0      ))
]

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
pred_probs = predict_proba_examples(examples,
                                    model_and_tokenizer=(model, tokenizer))

# pred_probs[i][j] = probability that examples[i].prompt is classified as
# examples[i].completions[j]
print([example_pred_probs.round(2)
       for example_pred_probs in pred_probs])
# [array([0.7, 0.3]),
#  array([0.97, 0.03, 0.  ])]

# for each example, which completion is most likely?
pred_class_idxs = [np.argmax(example_pred_probs)
                   for example_pred_probs in pred_probs]
print([example.completions[pred_class_idx]
       for example, pred_class_idx in zip(examples, pred_class_idxs)])
# ['Clarice Starling',
#  'Kevin Conroy']
```

See [`demos/copa.ipynb`](https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/blob/main/demos/copa.ipynb)
for a demonstration of a slightly harder classification task.


## Setup

If you intend on using OpenAI models,
[sign up for the OpenAI API here](https://openai.com/api/), and then set the environment
variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. For zero-shot classification, OpenAI models are currently far
ahead of others. But using them will cost ya üí∞!

## Motivation

Answer my [CrossValidated question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/601159/337906),
improve my understanding of LMs.

<details>
<summary>Product-y motivation</summary>

Create a more usable zero-shot text classification interface than
[classification via sampling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/classification) (CVS).
In CVS, completion tokens are sampled from a language model given a prompt.
[Cookbook here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqj7dkuvl7Byd5KQPUJRxc19BJt8wo0yHNwK84KfU3Q/edit).
With this package's `predict` interface, you no longer have to:
  1. study sampled completion strings which aren't in your label set
  2. figure out how to map them back to the label set
  3. figure out how to transform or point multi-token labels to single tokens, ignoring
  their semantics if they were transformed
  4. ignore your prior over multi-token labels.

All you have to do is figure out how to frame your classification task as a
`{prompt}{end_of_prompt}{completion}` string.

Computational performance

One concern was that CAPPr requires as many `model()` calls as there are classes. But
in the CAPPr scheme, we can simply cache each attention block's keys and values for the 
prompts. This feature is already supported by `AutoModelForCausalLM`s. See
[this code](https://github.com/kddubey/cappr/blob/main/cappr/huggingface/classify.py)
for the implementation. Note that this caching is not implemented for OpenAI models,
as I can't control their backend.
**This means that when running `cappr.openai` functions, you'll be on the *cappr (slow)* line** :-(

![](/demos/scaling_classes.png)

*Figure 1: [COPA](https://people.ict.usc.edu/~gordon/copa.html) dataset, repeating the choices to simulate multi-class classification tasks. [GPT-2 (small)](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) was run on a Tesla K80 GPU (whatever was free in Google Colab in March 2023, idk a lick of hardware lol). 160 classification inputs were processed in batches of size 32. Each point in the graph is a median of 5 runs. For classification via sampling (CVS), exactly 4 tokens were generated for each prompt, which is the number of tokens in `'\n\nAnswer A'`. 1-token times are also shown. But for COPA (and other multiple-choice style prompts), that may result in lower zero-shot accuracy, as most of the sampled choices come after the first token.*
